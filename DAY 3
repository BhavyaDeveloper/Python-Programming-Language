PROJECT 1 - IF ELSE
Condition Check
Learn to use conditionals in Python to check a conditions and tell the computer what to do in each case. e.g.

if <this condition is true>:

    <then execute this line of code>

What if the condition is false?
The else keyword is used to define a block of code that will execute if the condition checked in the if statement is false.

if pigs can fly:

    <Some code that will never execute>

else:

    print("This is real life")

Python Indentation
Understand the importance of indentation in Python as a way to make certain lines of code subsidaries of other lines of code.

e.g.

if 5 > 2: #This is a parent line of code

    print("yes") #this is a child line of code

Comparator Operators
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
== Equal to
!= Not equal to


Code soultion -

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

# symbol of comparison operators
# > greater than
# < smaller than
# <= less than equal to
# >= greater than equal to
# == equal to
# != not equal to

#using single = means you are assigning value to the variable (its assignment)
# using double == means you are checking that if value to the left is equal to the value in right

if height >=120 :
    print("you can ride the rollercoaster")
else :
    print("Sorry you have to grow taller before you can ride")





Project 2 - Modulo

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

# symbol of comparison operators
# > greater than
# < smaller than
# <= less than equal to
# >= greater than equal to
# == equal to
# != not equal to

#using single = means you are assigning value to the variable (its assignment)
# using double == means you are checking that if value to the left is equal to the value in right

if height >=120 :
    print("you can ride the rollercoaster")
else :
    print("Sorry you have to grow taller before you can ride")

Code Solution- 
#Modulo operator represented by %
# It basically represents the remainder left in divisions

#Example-below


# see what I did I made it a string character thats wrong print("10 % 5")
# correct way is below

print (10 % 3)
#Its 1
Number = int(input("Enter the number here"))
if Number % 2 == 1 :
    print("odd")
else :
    print("even")
# else wali condiiton k liye if statement ka False hona zaroori hai and vice versa
# here = signin if/else use nahi karne diya because voh value assignment hogaya
# if/else mai check karte hai toh == yeh vaala sign lagega
# print is used like printer joh likha hai vahi dubaara likh dega solution pane mai
# input function mai input daalne ko bolega and solution pane mai dikhayega to enter the value yahan print lagane ki
# zaroorat nahi hai

Project 3 - Nesting and Elif
You can put if/else statements inside other if/else statements. This is known as nesting. e.g.

if maths_score >= 90:
    if english_score >= 90:
        print("You're good at everything")
    else:
        print("You're good at maths")
if english_score >= 90:
    print("You're good at english)
In this case only when a student has over 90 on maths and english, do they get "You are good at everything".

Note: You can also have if statements that don't have a paired else statement.


Code Solution-

#playing with two variables

maths_score = int(input("what is your maths score?"))
english_score = int(input("what is your english score?"))

if maths_score >= 90:
    if english_score >= 90:
        print("You're good at everything")
    else:
        print("You're good at maths")
else:
    print("You're good at english")

Project 6 - LogicaL Operators
You can combine different conditions using logical operators.

A and B #Both conditions need to be true
C or D #Only one condition needs to be true
not E #The condition must be false

Update the code so that people age 45 to 55 (inclusive of both ages) ride for free. Use logical operators to check that the age is greater than 45, and it's also less than 55.

NOTE: The warning for simplification is just a suggestion. You can consider it and chose it, or you can ignore it. In this lesson I wanted to show you the and, or and not logical operators. So I recommend keeping the original code in case you come back to this lesson for review.

Project 7 - Treasure Island Project
Your goal today is to build a "Chose your own adventure game". Using what you have learnt in the lessons today you will be building a very simple version of this type of text game.

Use the flow chart linked here to create the game logic.

Once you've completed the project, you can always extend the game and make it more interesting!
